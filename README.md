# mcstatusbot
### Discord bot for Minecraft server status

# Setup
Follow the guide at DevDungeon [here](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/javascript-discord-bot-tutorial) up to the 'Write a simple test bot' step.

# Configuration
Edit `config.json`:
- Replace `"YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE"` with your bot token. *Keep it secret. Keep it safe.*
- Replace `"YOUR SERVER IP HERE"` with the IP address of the Minecraft server you want to poll. Domains that redirect to IP addresses ("play.exampleserver.net") will also work.
- Replace `"YOUR SERVER PORT HERE"` with the port number of the Minecraft server you want to poll.
